7/7   - 14:00-17:00 (3 hrs)     - Wrote a python script like Elhana asked. but the ssh is asking for a password, so I had to go back and try to access the HOST via ssh without password, could'nt solve this for now.
8/7   - 20:00-20:45 (0.75 hrs)  - Added a firefox web Dockerized app, still need to complete access to HOST via SSH without password

27/7  - 15:00-16:00 (1 hrs)     - Run simple .py scripts from embeded python version on host with no python - worked
28/7  - 16:00-21:00 (5 hrs)     - Embeded version has no pip or venv - found a way to install pip; works good.  cant use venv for some reason, even after installing it manually

30/7  - 14:00-19:00 (5 hrs)     - Success accessing the install dependencies but for some reason python still cant use them, cant think for a reason for that and no available documentation (used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49737721/adding-packages-to-python-embedded-installation-for-windows suggestion with a partial success)
2/8   - 15:00-19:00 (4 hrs)     - Looked at different python tools to solve the task, found py2exe and pyinstaller and made a POC, showed it to Elhanan and he asked to see it in Thursday, and that in the meanwhile ill keep trying to solve my former problem
4/8   - 11:30-16:30 (5 hrs)     - Still looking for a solution for the path problem, had decent progress but still no success, seems like the embedded python can use some packages and some not, might be related to packages with exe file in them, but im not sure. other then that, looked dipper into the tool i used to encapsulate the app so i can answer Elhanan questions more precisely.
5/8   - 13:30-18:00 (4.5 hrs)   - Continued searching for a solution for the path problem, tried all sorts of things, succeded using some packages, still cant tell why those work and the others dont - like i thought yesterday, maybe its related to exe files within the packge
6/8   - 17:30-19:30 (2 hrs)     - Still searching for a solution for the path problem, found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39539089/what-files-are-required-for-py-initialize-to-run/39541474#39541474. i think that the suggested solution there might be releted to our problem, but its for python 2 and its quite complicated, so ill see if i can adress this in the weekend before the next meeting with Elhanan
9/8   - 12:30-21:00 (8.5 hrs)   - Meeting with Elhanan in the morning, showed him the problem i bumped into and the solution i found.  he asked for "test multiple python interpreters (different python versions) and run wxpython script.", succeded doing this today

Title:          1st POC
Requirement:    Run wxPython application inside Docker container. 
Result:         Success - needed to install VcXsrv on the host (done using Chocolatey) - https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde

Title:          2nd POC
Requirement:    Access host's Windows Registry
Result:         Success - needed to connect the Docker container and the host via SSH in order to run scripts from the container on the host

Title:          3rd POC
Requirement:    Test resource allocation with wxPython container
Result:         Made a bash script to reveal Docker's resource consumption and allocation (Docker stats) 

Title:          4th POC
Requirement:    Create 2 virtual environments and install different versions of the same package 
Result:         Created 2 virtual environments, installed different wxPython versions on them

Other Tasks:
-----------------
1. Configured a test Dockerfile for running wxPython application
2. Installed and tested Docker Toolbox on local machine instead of Docker Desktop, since Docker Docker Desktop does not support Windows server 2008
3. Reaseached ways to expose GUI from Docker containers on host machines running Windows OS (see VcXsrv above)
4. Wrote a script to generate SSH keys and reaseached how to use "REG QUARY" functions
5. Wrote a script for executing script over SSH from the container (=local) on the host (=remote)
