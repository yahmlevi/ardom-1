24/06 - 11:30-15:00 (3.5 hrs)   - started working on wxpython's container poc dockerfile
25/06 - 17:00-19:00 (2 hr)      - success building the wxpython container, still can not run the container
28/06 - 11:00-18:00 (7 hrs)     - success running wxPython docker container (with GUI) and worked on windows based container for testing
29/06 - 12:00-16:45 (4.75 hrs)  - Researched for a solution to the WIN REG access problem, started working on it. also finished the resource consumption POC.
30/06 - 11:00-15:00 (4 hrs)     - Worked on connecting the Docker container to the host using SSH + executing scripts on the host (for read/write host's Windows Registry)
1/7   - 11:30-15-30 (4 hrs)     - Success in connecting the Docker container and the host via SSH, success running REG EDIT from container on host, still a few missing finishes
2/7   - 14:30-17:00 (2.5 hrs)   - Started working on user expirance issues and improved scripts.
6/7   - 12:00-14:30 (2.5 hrs)   - First go-no-go meeting with Elhanan. Started working on accessing to Windows Registry via python instead of REG QUERY like Elhanan asked.
7/7   - 14:00-17:00 (3 hrs)     - Wrote a python script like Elhana asked. but the ssh is asking for a password, so I had to go back and try to access the HOST via ssh without password, could'nt solve this for now.
8/7   - 20:00-20:45 (0.75 hrs)  - Added a firefox web Dockerized app, still need to complete access to HOST via SSH without password
10/7  - 11:00-13:15 (2.75 hrs)  - Success accessing HOST via SSH without password, first POC stage is complete
12/7  - 12:30-16:30 (4 hrs)     - Elhanan wanted to run diffrent wxpython code on wxpython's container, got some errors but fixed it 
13/7  - 12:00-15:00 (3 hrs)     - Still trying to figure out how to solve the problem that the wxPython new app raised, almost no documentation on that topic, so im trying all sorts of things
14/7  - 11:15-14:45 (3.5 hrs)   - Still trying to fix the error raised by the new wxpython container, found more information on the problem, looking for a good solution 
15/7  - 13:00-16:30 (3.5 hrs)   - Solved the Nvidia driver error i had, progrem runed successfully once and for some reason didnt run again, seems like the problem is related to system languge
16/7  - 13:15-17:00 (3.75 hrs)  - Solved last error but still application not loading, running out of ideas, so Elhanan and I will have a meeting Sunday and try another way
19/7  - 12:00-14:00 (2 hrs)     - Created 2 virtual environments, installed different wxPython versions on them for the sake of the POC
20/7  - 12:00-14:00 (2 hrs)     - Started creating bash files for automation of the task 
21/7  - 17:00-19:00 (2 hrs)     - Tried creating automation for the task with batch (.bat) files instaed of bash (.sh) files, with success
22/7  - 12:00-14:30 (2.5 hrs)   - Searched a way to 'containerize' an application without Docker, found few options and looked into them, selected one of the options (pyinstaller) and started working on it
23/7  - 11:30-16:00 (4.5 hrs)   - Containerized an wxPython application successuflly and runed it on a different windows 10 host successuflly
24/7  - 11:30-16:00 (4.5 hrs)   - Elhanan didnt aprove last finished'd task, and asked the following; "create a zip file which contains python and all the dependencies, and is executable from inside the file (don't need anything from the host) - creates python env and then runs the app". created another batch file and searched ways to zip python apps  

Title:          1st POC
Requirement:    Run wxPython application inside Docker container. 
Result:         Success - needed to install VcXsrv on the host (done using Chocolatey) - https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde

Title:          2nd POC
Requirement:    Access host's Windows Registry
Result:         Success - needed to connect the Docker container and the host via SSH in order to run scripts from the container on the host

Title:          3rd POC
Requirement:    Test resource allocation with wxPython container
Result:         Made a bash script to reveal Docker's resource consumption and allocation (Docker stats) 

Title:          4th POC
Requirement:    Create 2 virtual environments and install different versions of the same package 
Result:         Created 2 virtual environments, installed different wxPython versions on them

Other Tasks:
-----------------
1. Configured a test Dockerfile for running wxPython application
2. Installed and tested Docker Toolbox on local machine instead of Docker Desktop, since Docker Docker Desktop does not support Windows server 2008
3. Reaseached ways to expose GUI from Docker containers on host machines running Windows OS (see VcXsrv above)
4. Wrote a script to generate SSH keys and reaseached how to use "REG QUARY" functions
5. Wrote a script for executing script over SSH from the container (=local) on the host (=remote)
