24/6 - 11:30-15:00 (3 and half) - started working on wxpython's container poc dockerfile
25/6 - 17:00-19:00 (2) - success building the wxpython container, still can not run the container
28/6 - 11:00-18:00 (7) - success running wxPython docker container
29/6 - 12:00-

Title:          1st POC
Requirement:    Run wxPython application inside Docker container. 
Result:         Success - needed to install VcXsrv on the host (done using Chocolatey) - https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde

Title:          2nd POC
Requirement:    Access host's Windows Registry
Result:         Not posible as access requires Windows-based Docker image, which requires higher version than Windows Server 2008 on the host (server)

Other Tasks:
-----------------
1. Configured a test Dockerfile for running wxPython application
2. Installed and tested Docker Toolbox on local machine instead of Docker Desktop, since Docker Docker Desktop does not support Windows server 2008
3. Reaseached ways to expose GUI from Docker containers on host machines running Windows OS (see VcXsrv above)
