24/06 - 11:30-15:00 (3.5 hrs)   - started working on wxpython's container poc dockerfile
25/06 - 17:00-19:00 (2 hr)      - success building the wxpython container, still can not run the container
28/06 - 11:00-18:00 (7 hrs)     - success running wxPython docker container (with GUI) and worked on windows based container for testing
29/06 - 12:00-16:45 (4.75 hrs)  - Researched for a solution to the WIN REG access problem, started working on it. also finished the resource consumption POC.
30/06 - 11:00-15:00 (4 hrs)     - Worked on connecting the Docker container to the host using SSH + executing scripts on the host (for read/write host's Windows Registry)
1/7   - 11:30-15-30 (4 hrs)     - Success in connecting the Docker container and the host via SSH, success running REG EDIT from container on host, still a few missing finishes



Title:          1st POC
Requirement:    Run wxPython application inside Docker container. 
Result:         Success - needed to install VcXsrv on the host (done using Chocolatey) - https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde

Title:          2nd POC
Requirement:    Access host's Windows Registry
Result:         Success - needed to connect the Docker container and the host via SSH in order to run scripts from the container on the host

Title:          3rd POC
Requirement:    Test resource allocation with wxPython container
Result:         Made a bash script to reveal Docker's resource consumption and allocation (Docker stats) 

Other Tasks:
-----------------
1. Configured a test Dockerfile for running wxPython application
2. Installed and tested Docker Toolbox on local machine instead of Docker Desktop, since Docker Docker Desktop does not support Windows server 2008
3. Reaseached ways to expose GUI from Docker containers on host machines running Windows OS (see VcXsrv above)
4. Wrote a script to generate SSH keys and reaseached how to use "REG QUARY" functions
5. Wrote a script for executing script over SSH from the container (=local) on the host (=remote)
